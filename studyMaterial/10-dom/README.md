# 10. DOM & SEO

With the HTML DOM, JavaScript can access and change all the elements of an HTML document.

The HTML DOM (Document Object Model)
When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.

The HTML DOM model is constructed as a tree of Objects:

## What is SEO?

Making your content search-friendly matters because it's how you get more relevant users viewing your content. This is called search engine optimization (SEO), which can result in more interested users coming to your site. If Google Search has trouble understanding your page, you're possibly missing out on an important source of traffic.

## What is Front-end and Back-end SEO?
Front-end SEO, also called on-page SEO, includes all the elements a website user sees—copy, layout, images, and video. Front-end SEO is the realm of content experts and marketers. 

If you were in a play, front-end SEO would be actors reciting their lines, along with sets and lighting. We hear and see these elements, but generally don’t think about all it took for the play to take its final form. 

Unlike front-end SEO, back-end techniques typically require a developer’s expertise in HTML and CSS programming. WordPress has shifted some simpler SEO tasks to content and marketing staff. 

In the theater example, Back-end SEO might refer to set builders, paint, and lighting crews, and spotlights. They aren’t seen directly, but the audience sees the final results.
