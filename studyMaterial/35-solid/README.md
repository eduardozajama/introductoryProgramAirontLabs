# 35. SOLID Principles
## What is SOLID?
The invention of SOLID principles began in the late 80s. Robert C. Martin started to develop these principles while arguing the principle of software design on USENET (an early kind of Facebook). After addition and subtraction, Robert C. Martin formulated the principles in the early 2000s. It was until 2004 that the principles were arranged and called SOLID principles. It is an acronym that stands for five specific design principles.

S represents the Single Responsibility principle
O represents the Open Closed principle
L represents the Liskov Substitution principle
I represents the Interface Segregation principle
D represents the Dependency Inversion principle
The SOLID principles are useful when constructing both individual modules or larger architectures.

## Key features of the SOLID principle:

* The code reusability.
* Easy to make a code change in the feature.
* Keeps the code easy to maintain.
* Easy to write a test for the code.
