# 7. Semantic HTML
## What is semantic HTML?
Semantic HTML (also called semantic markup) is HTML code that uses HTML tags to effectively describe the purpose of page elements. Semantic HTML code communicates the meaning of its elements to both computers and humans, which helps web browsers, search engines, assistive technologies, and human developers understand the components of a web page.

The key to well-written semantic HTML is the use of semantic tags. Semantic HTML tags have names that tell the person or machine reading the code what exactly they’re meant to do.

Semantic Elements in HTML
Many web sites contain HTML code like: 
 
 ```<div id="nav">```  ```<div class="header">``` 
 ```<div id="footer">```
  to indicate navigation, header, and footer.
