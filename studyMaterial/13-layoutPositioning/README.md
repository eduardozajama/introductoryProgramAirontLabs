# 13. Layout positioning
When working with CSS you will eventually run into designs that require you to rearrange the layout of your document to reach your design goals. When faced with such a task CSS provides us with various ways of doing this.

1. Positions:
The position property sets how an element is placed or positioned in our document. The top, bottom, left, and right properties are used with position to set the placement of an element. They only have an effect on positioned elements. The position property also specifies the type of positioning method used for an element. It could either be static, relative, fixed, absolute or sticky.

2. Margin:
Margins can simply be said to be the space outside of the elements border. It affects the surrounding space based on what values we set the margin property to.

3. Padding:
Paddings are the space inside or within an element. It controls the space within an element based on what values we set the padding property to.
We should take note not to forget that the padding property is fundamentally different from the margin property so as to not mix them up.


4. Float:
The float property does what it says, it floats an element based on the value assigned to it.
The float property is pretty versatile and can be used in a number of different ways.
Essentially, the float property allows us to take an element, remove it from the normal flow of a page, and position it to the left or right of its parent element. All other elements on the page will then flow around the floated element. An <img> element floated to the side of a few paragraphs of text, for example, will allow the paragraphs to wrap around the image as necessary.

When the float property is used on multiple elements at the same time, it provides the ability to create a layout by floating elements directly next to or opposite each other, as seen in multiple-column layouts.

The float property accepts a few values; the two most popular values are left and right, which allow elements to be floated to the left or right of their parent element.
