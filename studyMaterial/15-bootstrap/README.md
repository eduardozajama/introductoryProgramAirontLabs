# 15. Bootstrap. Materialize CSS
## Flexbox vs. Bootstrap
It’s important to understand that Bootstrap’s grid system is built with Flexbox. What sets Bootstrap apart from using Flexbox alone is the process of writing code. With Bootstrap, you can create a grid using only HTML. With Flexbox, you must use HTML and CSS.

It allows up to 12 columns across the page.
If you do not want to use all 12 columns individually, you can group the columns together to create wider columns. The grid system is responsive, and the columns will re-arrange automatically depending on the screen size.
Make sure that the sum adds up to 12 or fewer (it is not required that you use all 12 available columns).
