# 36. MFA
## What is MFA?
Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) is an authentication method that requires the user to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to a resource such as an application, online account, or a VPN. MFA is a core component of a strong identity and access management (IAM) policy. Rather than just asking for a username and password, MFA requires one or more additional verification factors, which decreases the likelihood of a successful cyber attack.

## Why is MFA Important?
The main benefit of MFA is it will enhance your organization's security by requiring your users to identify themselves by more than a username and password. While important, usernames and passwords are vulnerable to brute force attacks and can be stolen by third parties. Enforcing the use of an MFA factor like a thumbprint or physical hardware key means increased confidence that your organization will stay safe from cyber criminals.

## How Does MFA work?
MFA works by requiring additional verification information (factors). One of the most common MFA factors that users encounter are one-time passwords (OTP). OTPs are those 4-8 digit codes that you often receive via email, SMS or some sort of mobile app. With OTPs a new code is generated periodically or each time an authentication request is submitted. The code is generated based upon a seed value that is assigned to the user when they first register and some other factor which could simply be a counter that is incremented or a time value.

## Three Main Types of MFA Authentication Methods
Most MFA authentication methodology is based on one of three types of additional information:

Things you know (knowledge), such as a password or PIN
Things you have (possession), such as a badge or smartphone
Things you are (inherence), such as a biometric like fingerprints or voice recognition
### MFA Examples
Examples of Multi-Factor Authentication include using a combination of these elements to authenticate:

### Knowledge
Answers to personal security questions
### Password
OTPs (Can be both Knowledge and Possession - You know the OTP and you have to have something in your Possession to get it like your phone)
### Possession
OTPs generated by smartphone apps
OTPs sent via text or email
Access badges, USB devices, Smart Cards or fobs or security keys
Software tokens and certificates
### Inherence
Fingerprints, facial recognition, voice, retina or iris scanning or other Biometrics

## What's the Difference between MFA and Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)?
MFA is often used interchangeably with two-factor authentication (2FA). 2FA is basically a subset of MFA since 2FA restricts the number of factors that are required to only two factors, while MFA can be two or more.
