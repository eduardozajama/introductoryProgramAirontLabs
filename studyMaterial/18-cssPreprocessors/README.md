# 18. CSS Preprocessors

## CSS preprocessor
A CSS preprocessor is a program that lets you generate CSS from the preprocessor's own unique syntax.

A CSS preprocessor is a scripting language that extends CSS and is compiled into regular CSS syntax. A browser can only understand CSS, which at times may not be enough to write clean and reusable rules. Using only CSS, the designer/developer is not able to reuse a collection of rules in multiple selectors which had unclear pieces of data across a stylesheet. To overcome most of these limitations, the concept of a preprocessor was created. It offered an advanced way of writing CSS that extends the basic functionalities. This advanced code is later compiled as normal CSS code that the browser will understand.

## What’s the difference between preprocessors?
### SASS VS LESS VS STYLUS
There are three main preprocessors – Sass, LESS and Stylus. Each CSS preprocessor has its own unique way of accomplishing the same task, even though about 80% of Sass, LESS and Stylus are the same. The other 20% is made up of minor differences in the advanced usage. All three preprocessors allow you to create variables, media queries, mixins, nesting, loops & conditionals and importing. All three let you abstract key design elements, use logic and write less code, which makes them all able to give you an advantage over basic CSS.


## Why Am I Supposed to know CSS Preprocessor ?
CSS preprocessors come in handy when we are developing large scale UI requiring heaving styling sheets.

Pros:
Create reusable code snippets that can be imported
Facilitates easier and efficient development
Makes code more organized, clean and helps avoid repetitions
Has Nested Syntax — Nesting of classes in CSS makes it easy to target DOM elements and saves you time. Nesting also makes it tremendously easy to edit CSS files.
Has special functionality of joining multiple stylesheets into one
Reduces number of errors and code bloat
CSS Preprocessor has many built-in functions Darken and Lighten e.g.functions
Ensures backward compatibility.
Cons:
Debugging is harder
Compilation slows down development
They can produce very large CSS files
Maintenance and over-engineering
Saving generated files (or not)
Capability and understanding
Knowledge available with developers
