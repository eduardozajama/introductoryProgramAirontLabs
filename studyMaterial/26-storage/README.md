# 26. Cookies vs Local Storage vs Session Storage
## What are they?
JavaScript provides three mechanisms for storing data on the client âˆ’ cookies, session storage, and local storage. Each one has advantages and disadvantages.

Local storage is the most recent mechanism. It allows for larger amounts of data to be stored, but the data is not deleted when the browser is closed. Local storage is useful for storing data that the user will need to access later, such as offline data.

Session storage is similar to cookies, but the data is only stored for the current session. This means that the data will be deleted when the user closes the browser. Session storage is useful for storing data that is sensitive, such as login credentials.

Cookies are the oldest and most well-known mechanism. They are simple to use and well supported by browsers. However, they are limited to 4KB of data and are often used to store data that is not sensitive, such as user preferences.
