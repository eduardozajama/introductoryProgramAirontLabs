# 31. OOP

## What is OOP?
OOP stands for object-oriented programming. It is a programming paradigm that revolves around the object rather than function and procedure. In other words, it is an approach for developing applications that emphasize on objects. An object is a real word entity that contains data and code. It allows binding data and code together.

## What is the purpose of using OOPs concepts?
The aim of OOP is to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism in programming. The main purpose of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.

## Components of Object-Oriented Programming
Object-oriented Programming has mainly 4 components – 

### Objects 
Object is the entity that makes the classes to be implemented into the program. It makes the features, properties, and behaviors of the class to be implemented. Example – A car is an object that has property color, model, brand name, fuel type, etc, and behaviors like, it runs. So these properties and behavior make an object (CAR).
### Classes
 A class can be stated as the blueprint of the object. This states what an object can do. It contains all the features, attributes, and behavior of what the model can do. We can say that class contains the definition of the object. Example – Car color, engine type, etc. And with the definition, we can create any number of  objects.
### Methods 
 Methods are the attributes of the class which are defined for the specified behavior of the object. It can also modify the state of the class. Example – Method to drive a car, It changes the state of the car from parking state to running state.
### Instances 
 It is the members of the class who holds some values related to the objects of the class.
